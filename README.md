#ActiveRecordLite

A barebones build-out of all the important, awesome features of the ActiveRecord pattern in Rails! Uses lots of Ruby meta-programming to built out ActiveRecord's associations.

The purpose of this project was to more fully understand how ActiveRecord works under-the-hood, especially when it comes to building associations, inferring table names from class names, and building out SQL queries.
